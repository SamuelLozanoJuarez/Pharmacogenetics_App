# Application context
Precision medicine is increasingly being applied in day-to-day clinical practice. Trends in medicine seem to be moving toward this paradigm: the end of the 'one size fits all' approach in favor of personalized and targeted treatments tailored to the specific characteristics of each patient.

From the perspective of pharmacogenetics, significant advances can be made with the aim of improving treatment effectiveness and reducing the risk of toxicity in patients. It is known that not all individuals metabolize the same drug in the same way; depending on the individual's genotype for certain genes, the body's response to the drug may vary.

This way, we can find patients who metabolize the treatment more quickly, known as 'Rapid Metabolizers', and therefore, the drug's half-life will be shorter than expected. Conversely, there are patients called 'Poor Metabolizers' in whom the half-life will be longer, increasing the risk of toxicity due to drug accumulation in the blood.

# Aim of the application
This project aims to develop a web application that allows clinicians to generate a pharmacogenetic report for a patient in relation to a specific drug. To achieve this, the application allows the input of the patient's genotype for a set of predefined genes (the main genes involved in drug metabolism used in oncology, cardiology, and psychiatry) and the desired drugs to be administered. The app searches databases for pharmacogenetic recommendations and provides the patient's phenotype, along with clinical recommendations for that phenotype to consider in drug administration.
